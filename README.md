# Brumby Code Checker- Eclipse Plugin

This repository is an extension to the Brumby Code Checker repository, and is dependent on having the BCC project in the same local environment as the plug in. The plug in gives added functionality to run the application in an eclipse GUI executed at the eclipse toolbar. The function of the program is the same as other methods of running. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
